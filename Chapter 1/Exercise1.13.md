Goal: Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to (phi^n)/5.

We know that Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2). We also know that Fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5).
We can apply the function to all terms in the first sequence and get:
(phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5) = (phi^(n-1) - psi^(n-1))/sqrt(5) + (phi^(n-2) - psi^(n-2))/sqrt(5)

$`\sqrt{2}`$
